# uploller-grafana-provsioning
this is a store for provisioning files for the granafa used in upoller (unifi poller) 

Copy the contents of this provisioning folder to the root of the folder defined by your provisioning env var.
Yes you also need the empty folders in the tree (the ones with .gitkeep file, you can delete this file once copied to your volume if you prefer)
Without this you will see various non-critical error messages in logs.
